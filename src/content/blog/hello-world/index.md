Welcome to my blog! This is where I share my thoughts on software development, technology, and projects I'm working on.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:

- Software engineering best practices
- Open source projects
- Tech tutorials and guides

## Code highlighting example

Here's how code blocks look on this site:

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  date: string;
}

const post: BlogPost = {
  title: "Hello World",
  description: "My first post",
  date: "2025-01-12"
};
```

Stay tuned for more content!
